🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel-related features. The solution emphasizes clean preprocessing, feature engineering, and automated model training using pipelines.

🧠 Model & Approach
